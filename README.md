# Project Showcase Website

## Project Description

This is a website to show off all the various projects that I am either working on or have completed.
This is also a pseudo directory to allow for easy navigation between these projects.

## How to Install and Run the Project

To utilize this website, please clone the repo and either host the base
folder or launch the index.html in your browser.

## How to Use the Project

You can use this project in one of two ways.
The first way would be to view this website on the deployed Github Page and use its functionality there.
Or you are more than welcome to download it, run it and utilize it in the same way as a normal website
